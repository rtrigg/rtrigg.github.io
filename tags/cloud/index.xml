      <description>The budget items and calculations for a on-premises data center are dramatically different when compared to those of cloud computing. Many of the costs of traditional on-premises infrastructure are taken care of by the cloud provider. Your organization is essentially renting the staff, compute hardware, and other infrastructure from the provider, cutting down on capital expenses, though gaining new operational expenses, that is, your cloud bill. You are also gaining the ability to scale the data center as needed.</description>

      <description>Virtualization allows for the creation of &amp;ldquo;virtual&amp;rdquo; computers and devices on one server. It is an effective strategy for partitioning and managing compute, storage, and network resources. Virtualization is not a new concept, but its popularity has waxed and waned over the decades.
Back in the days of mainframes, time-sharing was invented to allow multiple users to run code on one mainframe, but it had its limitations, so virtualization was created1.</description>

      <description>Trying to convince management it&amp;rsquo;s finally time to migrate or expand into the cloud? Perhaps you are new to cloud computing, and trying to learn more. Or maybe, you&amp;rsquo;re just wondering how well the NIST definition of cloud computing fits in 2022? It&amp;rsquo;s been over ten years since the words:
Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.</description>
