Cloud computing dramatically changes the budget calculations for a data center,
compared to an on-premises data center. In general, when evaluating the cloud,
many capital expenses of traditional on-prem infrastructure are taken care of
by the cloud provider. The organization is essentially renting the staff,
hardware, and other infrastructure, creating new operational expenses. An added
benefit to cloud hosting is the ability to scale the data center as needed.

Most people think of server racks, network-attached-storage, routers, switches,
etc., when they think of a data center. However, standing up an on-premise data
center requires a large amount of non-compute infrastructure. Picking an empty
room and filling it with computers will lead to large headaches and downtimes,
and possibly safety violations. Support infrastructure includes climate
control, fire suppression systems, security, raised floors, and a host of other
considerations (Techopedia 2017). Data centers also require a powerful network
connection with a fast up-speed if they are to be accessed offsite.

To ensure high uptime, the electrical infrastructure of an on-prem data center
needs to far exceed what might be acceptable in a standard office. Backup
generators, uninterruptible power supplies, and additional grounding are costs
that cannot be ignored (TRG Datacenters 2022). These infrastructure costs, like
HVAC systems and fire suppression, are taken care of by cloud providers. The
large capital expenses of compute, networking, and storage are also handled by
the cloud providers, and in general hosting a data center in the cloud will
move the IT budget toward additional operational expenses in exchange for
greatly reduced capital expenses.

There are aspects of duplication of infrastructure and avoiding catastrophic
failure that are difficult to budget for with an on-prem data center. A warm
offsite duplicate of the entire infrastructure would help guarantee uptime, but
this is extremely cost-prohibitive. There are also costs associated with an
on-prem data center that don't need to be budgeted for in a cloud setup. While
there are the capital costs mentioned previously, there are also operational
costs to an on-prem setup, like dedicated staff, which are externalized to the
cloud provider when running a data center in the cloud.

A data center hosted in the cloud has a fundamentally different capital and
operational expenses to one hosted on-prem. An on-prem setup requires enormous
up-front capital costs, including building infrastructure, electrical and
safety systems, and computer, networking, and storage hardware. On-prem data
centers also require dedicated staff to manage the local hardware, an
operational expense avoided when using cloud infrastructure. By reducing
capital expenses in exchange for new operational expenses of renting cloud
infrastructure, an organization can reduce overall costs; though the
organization will have new operational expenses, through the bill paid for to
their cloud provider. The initial cost of setting up a data center in the cloud
is much lower, and can scale to the precise level needed by the organization.
